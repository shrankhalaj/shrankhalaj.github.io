Applying PCA on the Iris flower dataset for analyzing and visualization. The data contain four continuous variables which corresponds to physical measures of flowers and a categorical variable describing the flowersâ€™ species. Used prcomp package and ggbiplot for the visualization.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
 setwd ('/Users/ankurjain/Desktop/Assignment')
Flowers = read.csv(file = 'Iris.csv', header=T, sep= ',')
summary (Flowers)
head(Flowers)

```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
log.ir<- log(iris[, 1:4])
ir.species <- iris[, 5]
ir.pca <- prcomp(log.ir,
                 center = TRUE,
                 scale. = TRUE) 
print(ir.pca)
```

## Including Plots



```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("ggbiplot", "vqv")
 
library(ggbiplot)
g <- ggbiplot(ir.pca, obs.scale = 1, var.scale = 1, 
              groups = ir.species, ellipse = TRUE, 
              circle = TRUE)
g <- g + scale_color_discrete(name = '')
g <- g + theme(legend.direction = 'horizontal', 
               legend.position = 'top')
print(g)
```
The plot clearly indicates that one class can be separated from the other two those are merging together. 

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
